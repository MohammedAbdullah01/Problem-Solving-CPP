### Problem 7: Print Half of a Number
Prompt the user for a number and print half of that number. This problem practices arithmetic operations and reading input.

### Problem 8: Pass or Fail Based on Marks
Ask the user for their marks, and print "PASS" if the marks are greater than or equal to 50, or "FAIL" if less than 50. This introduces conditional checks for numerical input.

### Problem 9: Calculate Sum of Three Numbers

Write a program that asks for the user’s age and checks if it’s valid (i.e., non-negative). If the input is invalid, prompt the user again.

### Problem 25: Validate Age with Retry
This problem is similar to Problem 24, but if the user enters an invalid age, the program should allow them to retry.
