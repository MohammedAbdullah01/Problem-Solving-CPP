## Problem Descriptions and Solutions (Level-3)

### Problem 1: Fill a 3x3 matrix with random numbers
The program generates a 3x3 matrix filled with random numbers between a specified range. It then prints the matrix.

### Problem 2: Sum of each row in a matrix
After filling the matrix with random numbers, the program computes and prints the sum of each row in the matrix.

### Problem 3: Store row sums in a separate array
Similar to Problem 2, this program sums the rows of a 3x3 matrix but stores the sums in a separate 1D array for easier access and manipulation.

### Problem 4: Sum of each column in a matrix
The program calculates the sum of each column in a 3x3 matrix and prints the results.

### Problem 5: Store column sums in a separate array
This is similar to Problem 4, but the column sums are stored in a separate 1D array and then printed..

### Problem 6: Fill a 3x3 matrix with ordered numbers
The program fills the matrix with ordered numbers starting from 1, increasing across rows and columns, and then prints the matrix.

### Problem 7: Transpose a matrix
The program fills a 3x3 matrix with ordered numbers and then transposes the matrix. The original matrix and its transposed version are printed.

### Problem 8: Multiply two matrices
The program multiplies two randomly filled 3x3 matrices and prints the result.

### Problem 9: Print the middle row and middle column
After filling a matrix with random numbers, the program prints the middle row and the middle column.

### Problem 10: Sum all numbers in a matrix
This program computes the sum of all the numbers in a 3x3 matrix and prints the result..

### Problem 11: Compare two matrices for equality
The program compares two 3x3 matrices and checks if they are equal.

### Problem 12: Check if two matrices are identical
Similar to Problem 11, this program compares two matrices and checks if they are identical.

### Problem 13: Check if a matrix is an identity matrix
The program checks if a given 3x3 matrix is an identity matrix. An identity matrix has 1's along its diagonal and 0's elsewhere.

### Problem 14: Check if a matrix is a scalar matrix
The program checks if a matrix is a scalar matrix, where all diagonal elements are the same, and all off-diagonal elements are zero

### Problem 15: Count the occurrences of a number in a matrix
This program prompts the user to enter a number and then counts how many times that number appears in a given 3x3 matrix.

### Problem 16: Check if a matrix is sparse
The program checks if a matrix is sparse. A sparse matrix has more zero elements than non-zero elements.

### Problem 17: Check if a number exists in a matrix
The program searches a 3x3 matrix to see if a specified number exists in the matrix.

### Problem 18: Find the intersection of two matrices
This program finds and prints the numbers that are present in both of two 3x3 matrices.

### Problem 19: Minimum and Maximum Numbers in Matrix
A program to find the minimum and maximum numbers in a matrix of integers. The matrix is filled with random numbers, and the program identifies the smallest and largest values.

### Problem 20: Check if Matrix is Palindrome
This program checks whether a matrix is a palindrome. A matrix is considered a palindrome if its elements are the same when the matrix is mirrored along its center.

### Problem 21: Fibonacci Series
The program prints the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci series.

### Problem 22: Fibonacci Series using Recursion
This problem prints the Fibonacci series of the first 10 numbers using recursion.

### Problem 23: Print First Letter of Each Word in a String
The program reads a string and prints the first letter of each word in the string.

### Problem 24: Uppercase First Letter of Each Word
This program takes a string and capitalizes the first letter of each word.

## Problem 25: Lowercase First Letter of Each Word
The program reads a string and converts the first letter of each word to lowercase.

### Problem 26: Uppercase and Lowercase All Letters in a String
This program converts a string to all uppercase and all lowercase letters, then prints the results.

### Problem 27: Invert Case of a Character
The program reads a character, inverts its case (from uppercase to lowercase and vice versa), and prints the result.

### Problem 28: Invert Case of All Letters in a String
This problem takes a string and inverts the case of all letters, printing the resulting string.

### Problem 29: Count Small and Capital Letters in a String
