# Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains solutions to a variety of programming problems. Each problem is addressed by a C++ program that prompts the user for input and prints the result to the screen. The problems are designed to practice and reinforce core programming concepts such as input/output, conditionals, loops, and basic mathematical operations.

## Problem Descriptions and Solutions

### Problem 1: Print Your Name
- Write a program that prints your name on the screen.

### Problem 2: Ask the User for Their Name
- Write a program that asks the user to enter their name and prints it.

### Problem 3: Odd or Even Number
- Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints whether it's "ODD" or "EVEN".

### Problem 4: Hired or Rejected Based on Age and License
- Write a program that asks the user for their age and whether they have a driver's license. Print "Hired" if the age is greater than 21 and the user has a license, otherwise print "Rejected".

### Problem 5: Hired or Rejected Based on Age, License, and Recommendation
- Write a program that asks the user for their age, whether they have a driver's license, and whether they have a recommendation. Print "Hired" if the age is greater than 21 and the user has a license, or if they have a recommendation. Otherwise, print "Rejected".
